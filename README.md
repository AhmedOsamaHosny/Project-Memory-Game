# Memory Game Project

The Memory Game is a well known game that depends on the ability to memorise recent things.

## Game Play
The game consists of a set of card pairs, each card is identical to its sibling in the pair. At the beginning all the cards are arranged in a grid and all the cards are covered.
Once the player clicks on any of the cards the card is shown and the player is required to click on its identical twin from the covered cards.
If he succeeds in choosing the identical card, then the pair is kept shown and this pair is eliminated from the set of pairs that the player is required to match, otherwise both the cards are covered again and the player still needs to match each of them to its sibling.
There is a timer that starts once the player clicks on the very first card.
If the player opens two cards this is counted as a move.
The player is required to match all the pairs in the least amount of time with the least amount of moves.
There are three stars that the player has in the beginning of the game, he loses them one by one as he executes more moves which indicates his performance.
